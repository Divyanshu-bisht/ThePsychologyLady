          <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a psychologist, counselor and trauma healer with a passion for guiding individuals toward emotional well-being and personal growth.
            <br /><br />
            With over six years of experience in training and teaching students across schools, colleges, and institutions, I have helped 5,000+ students shape their careers, overcome challenges, and build strong personalities. My three years of counseling and healing experience have allowed me to support clients dealing with stress, trauma, self-doubt, and relationship struggles.
            <br /><br />
            In addition to personal counseling, I specialize in developing training programs, equipping individuals with confidence and emotional intelligence. Through â€˜The Psychology Lady,â€™ I share insights that make healing a transformative journey. Whether youâ€™re seeking clarity, resilience, or a fresh perspective on life, I am here to support you on your path to self-discovery and empowerment.

                        <p><em>"The greatest revolution of our generation is the discovery that human beings, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds, can change the outer aspects of their lives."</em> - William James</p>

                    <p>When I'm not in practice, you'll find me hiking mountain trails, practicing yoga, or curled up with a good book on psychology or mindfulness. I believe that maintaining my own well-being allows me to be fully present for my clients.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm also passionate about mental health advocacy and regularly speak at community events, write for psychology publications, and mentor upcoming therapists in the field.</p>
