âœ¨ Redesign Project Spotlight: The Psychology Lady âœ¨

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a passion project close to my heart â€” a refreshed design for one of my favourite teachers @ Bhawana joshi's website, The Psychology Lady, a place that has deeply influenced how I see life.
Original site: https://thepsychologylady.com
My redesign: https://thepsychologylady.netlify.app

ðŸ¤” Why This Project Matters to Me:

As a student shaped by her guidance, Iâ€™ve always admired how she communicates lifeâ€™s complexities with warmth, clarity, and wisdom. Her site deserved a design that echoed that same eleganceâ€”and I was eager to help bring that vision to life.

ðŸ’­ What I Focused On in the Redesign:

Modern, Clean Visuals: Streamlined layout, refined typography, and a soothing color palette that reflects calm, clarity, and approachability.
User-Centered Experience: Improved readability and intuitive navigation to help visitors connect more meaningfully with her content.
Enhanced Responsiveness: Fully responsive across devices, with thoughtful attention to touch interactions, mobile layouts, and accessibility.
Preserved Personality: Kept her warm tone and voice intact, ensuring the design supportsâ€”not overshadowsâ€”her authentic presence.

ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts:

Working on this redesign wasnâ€™t just about code or aesthetics â€” it was a way to honour someone who guided me and countless others. Transforming her online presence into something beautiful, functional, and true to her essence was incredibly rewarding.

Hereâ€™s to mentors who teach not just lessons, but ways of being. ðŸ’–
Iâ€™d love for you to take a look at the redesign and share your thoughts!
